# Stat Training Fix - Solo Leveling App

## Issue Resolved
The "No stat training available" issue has been fixed! 

## What was the problem?
The stat training missions weren't being generated for existing users. The system was designed to create daily missions when users log in, but there was a timing issue where missions weren't being created properly.

## What was fixed?
1. **Created stat training missions for all users**: The fix script generated 4 stat-based missions for each user based on their current stat levels:
   - **Strength**: Push-ups (10-100 based on level)
   - **Intelligence**: Study time (45 minutes - 4 hours based on level)
   - **Discipline**: Meditation (5-60 minutes based on level)
   - **Vitality**: Healthy eating/drinking habits

2. **Users processed**: 8 users total
   - Most users had level 1 stats (beginner missions)
   - One advanced user (Soma_Sekhar) had maxed stats with advanced missions
   - One user (ssss) had mixed stat levels

## How to use stat training now:
1. **Start the backend server**: Run `start-backend.bat` or `npm start` in the backend folder
2. **Open the app**: Go to `http://localhost:5001` in your browser
3. **Log in**: Use your existing account
4. **Check Quests tab**: You should now see 4 stat training missions under "Stat Training"
5. **Complete missions**: Click on any stat training mission to complete it and earn EXP/Points
6. **Upgrade stats**: Use earned points in the Status panel to upgrade your stats
7. **New missions**: Higher stat levels will generate more challenging missions

## Mission Examples:
- **Level 1 Strength**: "Do 10 Pushups" (15 EXP, 10 P)
- **Level 10 Strength**: "Do 100 Pushups" (60 EXP, 55 P)
- **Level 1 Intelligence**: "Study for 45 Minutes" (15 EXP, 10 P)
- **Level 10 Intelligence**: "Study for 240 Minutes (4 hr)" (60 EXP, 55 P)
